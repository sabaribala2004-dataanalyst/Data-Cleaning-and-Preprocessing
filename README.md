## ðŸ“Œ Description  

This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task**.  
The dataset used is **KaggleV2-May-2016 (Medical Appointment No Shows)**, which contains information about patients, their scheduled appointments, and whether they showed up or not.  

The main objective of this task was to **clean and preprocess the raw dataset** to make it analysis-ready.  
Steps included: handling PatientId format, fixing date columns, standardizing text values, renaming columns, and checking for data quality issues.  

The final cleaned dataset (**Cleaned_KaggleV2.xlsx**) is consistent, structured, and ready for further analysis or visualization.
