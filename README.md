# Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

## ðŸ“Œ Description  

This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task**.  
The dataset used is **KaggleV2-May-2016 (Medical Appointment No Shows)**  , which contains information about patients, their scheduled appointments, and whether they showed up or not.  

The main objective of this task was to **clean and preprocess the raw dataset** to make it analysis-ready. The Steps included are handling PatientId format, fixing date columns, standardizing text values, renaming columns, and checking for data quality issues.  

The final cleaned dataset (**Cleaned_KaggleV2.xlsx**)  is consistent , structured, and ready for further analysis or visualization.

## Key tasks performed

- Converted column names into a consistent snake_case format.
- Fixed PatientId formatting by converting it to text (to prevent digit loss).
- Standardized date fields (scheduled_day, appointment_day) into dd-mm-yyyy format.
- Normalized categorical values (e.g., M â†’ Male, F â†’ Female).
- Verified data quality: no missing values and no duplicate rows.
- The final cleaned dataset is well-structured, consistent, and analysis-ready.
